# Cheer Me Up & Sing Me A Song

This project uses the [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) project to assess how you're feeling and sing you a song if you're feeling sad. Don't worry though—the page will stop the song immediately if it thinks you're angry about it.

To run locally, clone the files to your device:

```
  git clone git@github.com:javascriptforartists/cheer-me-up-and-sing-me-a-song.git  
```

Then simply start a server from the cloned directory and open the `index.html` file. That should be it!

If you're uncertain how or which way to serve the files locally I suggest the [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) project— a straightforward command-line http server.
